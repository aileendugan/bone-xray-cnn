# Introduction
Classifying Bone injuries(Fractures) from X-rays supplied by the Stanford ML group's MURA database. This CNN classifies normal (negative) and abnormal (positive) bone x-rays using the densenet169 architecture. Data organized for CNN using pandas dataframes. There are two versions. One that is classifying with training that only uses MURA images and another notebook that has additional synthetic x-ray images used. 

# How to Run

To run the CNN with only original MURA x-ray images as training data click [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1okU-_UnmNmwpV1bXIsebxhN_bPEuuBLs?authuser=2#scrollTo=G-c0Tbj1lJNy)

To run the CNN with addition synthetic training data click [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sxKIsB3zsOcdfYBjRfvfGYJWD0yzQ-fe?pli=1&authuser=2)
